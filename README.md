## üéì My learning path

I‚Äôve always been a curious and self-taught person. Alongside my formal education, I‚Äôve constantly built personal projects ‚Äî from console-based Rubik‚Äôs cube simulators to full-stack web tools or physical devices. That habit of making has always pushed me to explore beyond what‚Äôs taught in schools and to stay updated with the latest technologies.

- CFGM in Electronics & Telecommunications
- CFGS in Industrial Automation & Robotics (ARI)
- CFGS in Web Application Development (DAWe)
- University studies in Industrial Engineering (3 years)
- University studies in Computer Science (3 years)

From Excel-based programs back in 2014 to learning VBA and Arduino at school, to coding full apps in JavaScript ‚Äî learning by doing has always been my favorite route.

## üë§ About me

Growing up, I struggled to choose a single path. It took me a while to understand what I wanted to do, because honestly, there are just too many things I love doing. In another life, maybe I would‚Äôve studied Product Design. But instead of choosing only one path, I‚Äôve followed the thread of curiosity ‚Äî from school to side projects, from code to craft.

I‚Äôve always kept a strong autodidact mindset. School taught me the basics, but it was in my personal experiments where I found the real spark. That constant desire to make something ‚Äî anything ‚Äî has been my north star. And even when things don't seem to connect at first, I trust the process. Eventually, everything finds its place.

My studies pointed me in one direction, but my curiosity always pulled me in many. I spent three years in Industrial Engineering and three more in Computer Science and although I didn't finish, I left with valuable insights and no regrets ‚ú®

Parallel to my studies, my journey started with **Excel** in 2014 ‚Äî creating messy but functional programs with linked cells. Eventually, I discovered **VBA** through free courses at [Barcelona Activa](https://www.barcelonactiva.cat) and got hooked on making complete programs inside an excel file. Later on, Arduino introduced me to a whole new universe of physical interaction. That‚Äôs when I dove into C++, building a full Rubik‚Äôs Cube simulator in ASCII from scratch.

And from then on, I never stopped coding and building personal projects at home ‚Äî always learning by doing.

Nowadays, I'm putting all that energy into [fabri.cat](fabri.cat) ‚Äî a space to give my creations a home. A brand I've always wanted to build, now slowly taking shape. My dream is to offer gear I design and make, through a personalized experience on my website.

Last time i checked i did rubiks cube in 30"
