## 🎓 My learning path

I’ve always been a curious and self-taught person. Alongside my formal education, I’ve constantly built personal projects — from console-based Rubik’s cube simulators to full-stack web tools or physical devices. That habit of making has always pushed me to explore beyond what’s taught in schools and to stay updated with the latest technologies.

- CFGM in Electronics & Telecommunications
- CFGS in Industrial Automation & Robotics (ARI)
- CFGS in Web Application Development (DAWe)
- University studies in Industrial Engineering (3 years)
- University studies in Computer Science (3 years)

From Excel-based programs back in 2014 to learning VBA and Arduino at school, to coding full apps in JavaScript — learning by doing has always been my favorite route.

## 🎯 Philosophy

> Creativity is my compass. Code, tools, fabric, sensors, bicycles — it’s all part of the same universe. I build stuff because I believe ideas deserve a body.
It took me a while to understand what I wanted to do, because honestly, there are just too many things I love doing. In another life, maybe I would’ve studied Product Design. But instead of choosing only one path, I’ve followed the thread of curiosity — from school to side projects, from code to craft.

I’ve always kept a strong autodidact mindset. School taught me the basics, but it was in my personal experiments where I found the real spark. That constant desire to make something — anything — has been my north star. And even when things don't seem to connect at first, I trust the process. Eventually, everything finds its place.
